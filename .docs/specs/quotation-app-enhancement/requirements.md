## 3. Requirements Specification

### 3.1 UI Framework Migration Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Bootstrap to MUI Migration
**User Story**: As a developer, I want to migrate from Bootstrap to Material-UI so that the application has a modern, consistent design system and better component architecture.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL render all components using MUI instead of Bootstrap
2. WHEN users interact with form elements THEN the system SHALL maintain identical functionality with MUI components
3. WHEN the layout is displayed THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing responsive design structure
4. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL NOT include Bootstrap dependencies
5. IF a component requires custom styling THEN the system SHALL use MUI's styling solutions (sx prop, styled components, or theme)

#### 3.1.2 Design Consistency
**User Story**: As a user, I want the interface to look and feel the same after migration so that my workflow is not disrupted.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the migrated app is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual layout as the Bootstrap version
2. WHEN comparing color schemes THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing color palette and styling
3. WHEN measuring component spacing THEN the system SHALL maintain equivalent padding and margins
4. WHEN testing responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL preserve the same breakpoint behavior

### 3.2 Clear Functionality Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Clear All Items
**User Story**: As a user, I want to clear all items from the quotation table with a single click so that I can start fresh without deleting items individually.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN I click the Clear button THEN the system SHALL remove all items from the quotation table
2. WHEN the table is cleared THEN the system SHALL display the "No items" message with shopping cart icon
3. WHEN the table is cleared THEN the system SHALL reset the total amount to zero
4. WHEN the table is cleared THEN the system SHALL reset the total discount to zero
5. IF there are no items in the table THEN the Clear button MAY be disabled or show appropriate visual feedback

### 3.3 Discount Management Requirements

#### 3.3.1 Discount Input Field
**User Story**: As a user, I want to add a discount amount for each item so that I can apply specific discounts to individual products in my quotation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN adding an item THEN the system SHALL provide a discount input field in the form
2. WHEN I enter a discount value THEN the system SHALL accept numeric values (positive numbers only)
3. WHEN no discount is entered THEN the system SHALL default to zero discount
4. WHEN I submit the form THEN the system SHALL include the discount value with the item data
5. IF a negative discount is entered THEN the system SHALL either prevent submission or convert to zero

#### 3.3.2 Discount Calculation Logic
**User Story**: As a user, I want discounts to be applied correctly to the total amount so that my quotation calculations are accurate.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN calculating item amount THEN the system SHALL use formula: (Price × Quantity) - Discount
2. WHEN discount exceeds (Price × Quantity) THEN the system SHALL set amount to zero (not negative)
3. WHEN displaying amounts THEN the system SHALL show the discounted amount in the Amount column
4. WHEN calculating totals THEN the system SHALL sum all discounted amounts
5. IF discount is zero THEN the system SHALL display the amount as (Price × Quantity)

#### 3.3.3 Discount Display Requirements
**User Story**: As a user, I want to see discount information clearly in the table so that I can verify discount applications.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN viewing the quotation table THEN the system SHALL display a Discount column
2. WHEN an item has a discount THEN the system SHALL show the discount amount in the Discount column
3. WHEN an item has no discount THEN the system SHALL show "0" or "-" in the Discount column
4. WHEN viewing table footer THEN the system SHALL display total discount amount
5. WHEN calculating total discount THEN the system SHALL sum all individual item discounts

### 3.4 Enhanced Add Functionality Requirements

#### 3.4.1 Redundant Item Detection
**User Story**: As a user, I want redundant items to be automatically merged when adding products so that my quotation table remains clean and organized.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN adding an item THEN the system SHALL check for existing items with same product name AND same price
2. IF an item with same name and same price exists THEN the system SHALL merge quantities and add discounts
3. IF an item with same name but different price exists THEN the system SHALL treat as unique item and add separately  
4. WHEN merging items THEN the system SHALL calculate: new_quantity = existing_quantity + added_quantity
5. WHEN merging items THEN the system SHALL calculate: new_discount = existing_discount + added_discount

#### 3.4.2 Item Merging Logic
**User Story**: As a user, I want the system to handle item merging intelligently so that I don't have duplicate entries for the same product at the same price.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN comparing items for redundancy THEN the system SHALL check both product name (case-insensitive) AND price (exact match)
2. WHEN an exact match is found THEN the system SHALL update the existing item instead of creating new one
3. WHEN merging quantities THEN the system SHALL ensure the result is a valid positive number
4. WHEN merging discounts THEN the system SHALL ensure the total discount doesn't exceed the total amount before discount
5. IF merging would result in invalid data THEN the system SHALL add as separate item

### 3.5 Data Preservation Requirements

#### 3.5.1 Existing Data Structure
